<li>hypertext markup language
  HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li> 
<li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
<li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
<li>text elements,image elements,header elements,list elements</li>
<li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the <head> and <body> elements.</li>
<li>The <head> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
<li>The <body> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
