<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
<li>hypertext markup language
  HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.
  An element is a type of content on a webpage.
  -text elements,image elements,header elements,list elements
  Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the <head> and <body> elements.
    The <head> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.
      The <body> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.
